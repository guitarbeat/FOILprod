  abstract  = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive for a wide range of applications such as displays{,} light-emitting devices{,} and sensors due to their properties such as tunable fluorescence wavelength{,} high brightness{,} and narrow bandwidth. Most of the applications require precise patterning of QDs with targeted properties on solid-state substrates. Herein{,} we have developed a haptic-interfaced bubble printing (HIBP) technique to enable high-resolution (510 nm) high-throughput (>104 µm s−1) patterning of QDs with strong emission tunability and to significantly enhance the accessibility of the technique via a smartphone device. The scalability and versatility of the HIBP are demonstrated in our arbitrary patterning of QDs on plasmonic substrates. A detailed study of plasmonic and photothermal interactions is performed via programmed stage movements to realize tunability of the emission wavelength and lifetime. Finally{,} the influence of the hand movement on the properties of the printed QDs in terms of emission wavelength tuning from yellow to blue is established. This work provides a single-step macroscale platform to manipulate nanoscale properties at high resolution and high throughput.}
