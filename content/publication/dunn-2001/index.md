abstract: A method for dynamic, high-resolution cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging is presented in this article. By illuminating the cortex with laser light and imaging the resulting speckle pattern, relative CBF images with tens of microns spatial and millisecond temporal resolution are obtained. The regional CBF changes measured with the speckle technique are validated through direct comparison with conventional laser-Doppler measurements. Using this method, dynamic images of the relative CBF changes during focal cerebral ischemia and cortical spreading depression were obtained along with electrophysiologic recordings. Upon middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, the speckle technique yielded high-resolution images of the residual CBF gradient encompassing the ischemic core, penumbra, oligemic, and normally perfused tissues over a 6 $\times$ 4 mm cortical area. Successive speckle images demonstrated a further decrease in residual CBF indicating an expansion of the ischemic zone with finely delineated borders. Dynamic CBF images during cortical spreading depression revealed a 2 to 3 mm area of increased CBF (160% to 250%) that propagated with a velocity of 2 to 3 mm/min. This technique is easy to implement and can be used to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of CBF changes with high resolution in studies of cerebral pathophysiology.
