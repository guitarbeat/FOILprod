abstract: We present a new instrument, based on a low-frame-rate (8Hz) CCD camera used in a heterodyne optical-mixing configuration, that can create wide-field laser Doppler maps. As an illustration, we show results obtained in a mouse brain, in vivo, showing the Doppler signature of blood flow. The instrument is based on a frequency-shifting digital holography scheme.
