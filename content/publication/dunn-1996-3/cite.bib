  abstract = {Using the finite-difference time-domain method, three-dimensional scattering patterns are computed for cells containing multiple organelles. The scattering cross section and average cosine of the scattering angle are computed for cells as a function of volume fraction of melanin granules and mitochondria. Results show that small organelles play a significant role in light scattering from cells, and the volume fraction of organelles affects both the total amount of scattered light and the angular distribution of scattered light.},
