abstract: We combine the finite-difference time-domain method with pulse response techniques in order to calculate the light scattering properties of biological cells over a range of wavelengths simultaneously. The method we describe can be used to compute the scattering patterns of cells containing multiple heterogeneous organelles, providing greater geometric flexibility than Mie theory solutions. Using a desktop computer, we calculate the scattering patterns for common homogeneous models of biological cells and also for more complex representations of cellular morphology. We find that the geometry chosen significantly impacts scattering properties, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of appropriate theoretical models of cellular scattering and for accurate microscopic determination of optical properties.
