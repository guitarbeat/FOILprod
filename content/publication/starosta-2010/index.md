abstract: A linear coherent superposition method for estimating the plane wave far-field scattering pattern from multiple biological cells computed by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is presented. The method enables the FDTD simulation results of scattering from a small number of complex scatterers, such as biological cells, to be used to estimate the far-field pattern from a large group of those same scatterers. The superposition method can be used to reduce the computational cost of FDTD simulations by enabling a single large scattering problem to be broken into smaller problems with more practical computational requirements. It is found that the method works best in cases where there is little multiple scattering interaction between adjacent cells, so the far-field pattern of multicell geometry can simply be calculated as a phase-adjusted linear superposition of the scattering from individual cells. A strategy is also presented for choosing the minimum number of cells in cases with significant multiple scattering interactions between cells.
