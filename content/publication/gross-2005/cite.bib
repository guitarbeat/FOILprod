  abstract  = {A new technique is presented for measuring the spectral broadening of light that has been multiply scattered from scatterers in motion. In our method the scattered light is detected by a heterodyne receiver that uses a CCD as a multipixel detector. We obtain the frequency spectrum of the scattered light by sweeping the heterodyne local oscillator frequency. Our detection scheme combines a high optical etendue (product of the surface by the detection solid angle) with an optimal detection of the scattered photons (shot noise). Using this technique, we measure, in vivo, the frequency spectrum of the light scattered through the breast of a female volunteer.}
