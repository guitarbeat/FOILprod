  abstract  = {Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) is currentlyperformed clinically as an effective treatment for end-stageglaucoma. We develop a theoretical model for the analysis ofoptical attenuation phenomena during TSCPC as a basis for selection ofan optimal wavelength. A multilayered Monte Carlo model wasdeveloped to calculate the fluence and the rate of heat generation ineach tissue layer for the wavelengths of Nd:YAG, diode, ruby, kryptonyellow, and argon lasers. Of the five wavelengths under study, ourtheoretical results suggest that the diode laser wavelength offers thebest penetration through the conjunctiva, sclera, and ciliary muscleand highest absorption within the ciliary pigmentepithelium.}
