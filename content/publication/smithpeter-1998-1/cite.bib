  abstract  = {We present experiments to predict the maximum penetration depth atwhich typical biological structures in amelanotic tissue can bedetected with confocal microscopy. The detected signal is examinedas the signal source strength (index of refraction mismatch), thesource depth, and the medium scattering coefficient are varied. Thedetected background produced by scattering outside the focal volume isexamined as the medium scattering coefficient, the depth in the medium,the dimensionless pinhole radius, $\nu$p, and theshape of the scattering phase function are varied. When the systemapproaches ideal confocal performance ($\nu$p $\simeq$3), the penetration depth is limited by the signal-to-noiseratio to approximately 3--4 optical depths (OD's) for a 0.05 indexmismatch. As $\nu$p increases to 8, thepenetration depth is limited by the signal-to-background ratio and isdependent on the scattering coefficient. At $\mu$s$=$ 100 cm-1 (ls $=$ 100$\mu$m) and an index mismatch of 0.05, the maximum penetrationdepth is approximately 2 OD.}
