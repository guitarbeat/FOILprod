  abstract = {{ Background Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in awake behaving mice is well positioned to bridge the detailed cellular-level view of brain activity, which has become available due to recent advances in microscopic optical imaging and genetics, to the macroscopic scale of human noninvasive observables. However, while microscopic (e.g., 2-photon imaging) studies in behaving mice have become a reality in many laboratories, awake mouse fMRI remains a challenge. Furthermore, due to variability in behavior between animals, performing all types of measurements within the same subject is highly desirable and can lead to higher scientific rigor. Methods Here, we demonstrate Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI in awake mice implanted with chronic “cranial windows” that allow optical access for microscopic imaging modalities and optogenetic (OG) stimulation. We start with 2-photon imaging of single-vessel diameter changes (N=1). Next, we implement intrinsic optical imaging of blood oxygenation and flow combined with laser speckle imaging of blood flow obtaining a “mesoscopic” picture of the hemodynamic response (N=16). Then, we obtain corresponding BOLD fMRI data (N=5). All measurements can be performed in the same mice in response to identical sensory and OG stimuli. Results The cranial window does not deteriorate the quality of fMRI and allows alternating between imaging modalities in each subject. Conclusions This report provides a proof of feasibility for multiscale imaging approaches in awake mice. In the future, this protocol can be extended to include complex cognitive behaviors translatable to humans, such as sensory discrimination or attention.}},
