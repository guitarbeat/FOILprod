abstract: Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a technique for dynamic visualization of blood flow on tissue surfaces. LSCI produces images of blood flow in real-time using very simple instrumentation without the need for exogenous contrast agents, and has been widely used both in pre-clinical studies of neurological disease as well as clinical applications for monitoring of perfusion. One of the limitations of LSCI is the challenge of obtaining quantitative blood flow information. An extension to LSCI called multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI) overcomes some of these limitations and enables repeated blood flow measurements to be performed reliably. This chapter describes MESI imaging and the use of LSCI in humans during neurosurgery.
