  abstract  = {A numerical model was developed to simulate the effects of tissueoptical properties, objective numerical aperture (N.A.), andinstrument performance on two-photon-excited fluorescence imaging ofturbid samples. Model data are compared with measurements offluorescent microspheres in a tissuelike scattering phantom. Ourresults show that the measured two-photon-excited signal decaysexponentially with increasing focal depth. The overall decayconstant is a function of absorption and scattering parameters at bothexcitation and emission wavelengths. The generation of two-photonfluorescence is shown to be independent of the scattering anisotropy,g, except for g \&gt; 0.95. TheN.A. for which the maximum signal is collected varies with depth,although this effect is not seen until the focal plane is greater thantwo scattering mean free paths into the sample. Overall,measurements and model results indicate that resolution in two-photonmicroscopy is dependent solely on the ability to deliver sufficientballistic photon density to the focal volume. As a result we showthat lateral resolution in two-photon microscopy is largely unaffectedby tissue optical properties in the range typically encountered in softtissues, although the maximum imaging depth is strongly dependent onabsorption and scattering coefficients, scattering anisotropy, andobjective N.A..}
