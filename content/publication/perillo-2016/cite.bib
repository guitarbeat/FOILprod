  abstract  = {Here we demonstrate that a mode-locked ytterbium fiber laser for two-photon fluorescence microscopy can be built for \$13,000. The laser emits at a wavelength of 1060 nm with a usable average power of 1 W at a repetition rate of 40 MHz and a compressed pulse width of 81 fs at the sample. The laser is used to obtain deep in vivo two-color images of layer-V pyramidal neurons expressing YFP and vasculature labelled with Texas Red at depths up to 900 {\textmu}m. The sub-1 {\textmu}m features of dendritic spines can be resolved at a 200 {\textmu}m depth.}
