abstract: The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique is used to compute light scattering from biological cells in two dimensions. Results are presented for the computed scattering patterns of cells containing multiple organelles. This method provides considerably more flexibility than Mie theory because of its ability to model inhomogeneous objects such as cells.
