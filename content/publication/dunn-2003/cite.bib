  abstract  = {A simple instrument is demonstrated for high-resolution simultaneous imaging of total hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation and blood flow in the brain by combining rapid multiwavelength imaging with laser speckle contrast imaging. The instrument was used to image changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and blood flow during cortical spreading depression and single whisker stimulation in rats through a thinned skull. The ability to image blood flow and hemoglobin concentration changes simultaneously with high resolution will permit detailed quantitative analysis of the spatiotemporal hemodynamics of functional brain activation, including imaging of oxygen metabolism. This is of significance to the neuroscience community and will lead to a better understanding of the interrelationship of neural, metabolic, and hemodynamic processes in normal and diseased brains.}
