  abstract  = {We have examined the light-scattering properties of inhomogeneousbiological cells through a combination of theoretical simulations andgoniometric measurements. A finite-difference time-domain(FDTD) technique was used to compute intensity as a function ofscattering angle for cells containing multiple organelles and spatiallyvarying index of refraction profiles. An automated goniometer wasconstructed to measure the scattering properties of dilute cellsuspensions. Measurements compared favorably with FDTDpredictions. FDTD and experimental results indicate that scatteringproperties are strongly influenced by cellular biochemical andmorphological structure.}
