  abstract  = {The growth of computing power has greatly improved our ability to extract quantitative information about complicated three-dimensional structures from microscope images. New hardware techniques are also being developed to provide suitable images for these tasks. However, a need exists for synthetic data to test these new developments. The work reported here was motivated by studies of embryo health, but similar needs exist across the field of microscopy. We report a rigorous computer model, based on Maxwell's equations, that can produce the required synthetic images for bright-field, differential interference contrast, interferometric imaging, and polarimetric imaging. After a description of the algorithm, sample results are presented, followed by a discussion of future plans and applications.}
