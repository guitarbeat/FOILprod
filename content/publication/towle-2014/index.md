abstract: Recent experiments have concluded that it is possible to interrupt the vision of human subjects using infrared (IR) light through an effect known as thermal lensing. While these experiments successfully demonstrated the influence of thermal lensing on an Amsler grid target, little has been done to quantify the amount of visual disruption resulting from this phenomenon. Therefore, an artificial eye system was configured to better quantify the refractive power of the thermal lens generated within the human eye. The influence of 1319 nm energy with power levels from 220 to 630 mW and exposure durations between 0.25 and 1.00 s was evaluated based on changes induced within a visible probe beam (542 nm). Results showed up to a -2.0 D blur could be induced in human subjects using these energy levels. Results also established a relationship between the peak IR power and exposure durations used to determine the strength of the thermal lens.
