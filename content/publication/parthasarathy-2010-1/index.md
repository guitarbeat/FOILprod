abstract: Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) has become a widely used technique to image cerebral blood flow *in vivo*. However, the quantitative accuracy of blood flow changes measured through the thin skull has not been investigated thoroughly. We recently developed a new Multi Exposure Speckle Imaging (MESI) technique to image blood flow while accounting for the effect of scattering from static tissue elements. In this paper we present the first *in vivo* demonstration of the MESI technique. The MESI technique was used to image the blood flow changes in a mouse cortex following photothrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The Multi Exposure Speckle Imaging technique was found to accurately estimate flow changes due to ischemia in mice brains *in vivo*. These estimates of these flow changes were found to be unaffected by scattering from thinned skull.
