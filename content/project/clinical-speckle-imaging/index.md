Monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neurosurgery can provide important physiological information during a variety of highly-invasive procedures. These measurements could be useful for assessing whether blood flow has returned to presurgical baseline levels or for determining postsurgical tissue viability. [Laser speckle contrast imaging]({{< relref "/project/laser-speckle-contrast-imaging" >}}) (LSCI) has been used extensively for quantitative CBF imaging during preclinical research with animal models.

We are working to develop translational LSCI systems for real-time clinical applications during neurovascular procedures such aneurysm clippings or tumor resections. Our current designs adapt onto commercial neurosurgical microscopes ([Fig. 1](#figure-schematic)) and allow for continuous CBF imaging without disrupting normal use.
